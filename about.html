            <h2 class="side-title">Get to know me.</h2>
            <p class="about">
                At the end of 2019 I decided to take a little sabbatical from my old career over-seas, and visit my friends and family back home. I had not returned in nearly a decade, so it was quite a change being back home in America. We all know what happened in early 2020, after covid struck. This affected my life quite dramatically, leaving my old job redundant and forcing me to adapt back home. Seeing on how my previous job was not relevant here, and how I was a single parent with a young child, I decided to go back to school and change careers.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                Going back to school in your 30s is quite different. Because you are more mature, you tend to put more effort into learning. You also tend to ask more questions and put more effort into understanding the assignment. But I enjoy learning, and my instructors always seem to be available and ready to help.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                My previous work was all centered towards education. I have worked in a few language centers, international kindergartens, and university. I started teaching English as a second language and transitioned towards helping students who wanted to go abroad improve their spoken command of English, as well as learning more about western culture. Since these students already knew they wanted to go abroad in a western culture, I could share my experience being a westerner coming to China, and give them some advice on what they might want to learn, or things they might want to bring.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I chose to go into Information Technology and Software Development, because I saw how the world was advancing and every-day items were becoming more technologically advanced. Smart air-conditioning units, refrigerators, and televisions made me realize that most objects we interact with on a daily basis have some sort of computer in them, and if I wanted to be useful and have a career in the future I should learn about technology.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                While in China, I did a lot of self-study using the internet and talking with colleagues about programming and technology. As a man who is more comfortable in the woods than with technology this was quite a process for me. After 6 long years, I decided to take the plunge and just go to school for IT & Development and make it my career focus.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                Since learning about software, I have found a love for game development. Although I played video games growing up, they were never really an influential part of my life or a hobby, but rather more of an escape giving me something to do to pass time. But learning how much effort and work goes into developing a game, and the process just gets me excited and wanting to develop more projects.
